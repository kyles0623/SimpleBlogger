ToDos and Ideas for CrazyStat:
 - improve data privacy:
   - change anonymizeIP: Strip off the last 1 or 2 Octets and create a virtual IP:
     123.456.789.012 -> 123.456.OCT1.OCT2
     OCT1=ORD(User Agent + Resolution + Color Depth + salt)%256
     OCT2=ORD(User Agent - Resolution - Color Depth + salt)%256
     -> create an anonymized virtual IP that looks like a real one and still has the
     first / secnd Octet
   - optionally automaticalls delete logs after a defined period of time or x MB
     log usgae
   - opt-out mechanism (using opt-out-header? Cookie?)
   - optionally do not log referers or optionally delete referers after x days
   - create a data privacy statement that users can put on their site which explains
     how CrazyStat treats personal data.
   - contact https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/tracking/ and aks whether
     CrazyStat is conform with German data privacy laws  
 - IE9: Lyteframes have useless scrollbars!? :(
 - Do not show limit/all symbol in tree Referer-Module if there are
   only LIMIT entries to show. To do this, the referers need to be grouped before
   konsole() is started to know the number of hosts at that point. 
 - show_log: link IP-adresses (if not anonymized) to a lookup site (configurable)
   like http://ip-whois-lookup.com/lookup.php?ip= or
   http://www.infosniper.net/index.php?ip_address=
 - refererTree: link to Domain (not only subpage)
 - sortable table: display sort-icon onmousover
 - special default-preset with the settings of the last session
 - menu: breadcrumbs: Statistic > Logs > stat.log
 - menu: on mobile phone, the buttons where not shown
 - translate the logtool
 - fix: show_log (backwards) says "end of logfile" for files with just 1 line
 - Animate Bar charts (optional)
 - Presets: One icon, on mouseover a menu opens with all the presets using JS (no <select>)
 - when clicking on an entry in a module, start a filter in show_log which shows the individual
   hits for this entry. E.g. when clicking on a day in hits/day, show all hits of that
   day in show_log
 - show_log.php: Colorize rows (each IP has its own color)
 - show_log.php: When clicking an IP in the logs, start a filter/search for that IP
   (also for User Agents? Color Depth? Screen resolution?)
 - month-module: visits/day so that the current month can be easily compared
   (also  for other modules?)#
 - year-module?
 - javascript-module?
 - upload ("share") your presets
 - (upload logfiles via GUI that have been backed up)
 - every user controls its own presets
 - save multiple files in "Logs"
 - "Logs" (filter): Show how many search results (hits/visitors?)
 - Referer / Keywords: change table-layout so that keywords is just under system
 - Hits/day this / last month 
 - limit/total: instead of toolbar-button some fancy image under the list?
   load onScroll? onLoad (this means after everything has been loaded, fetch the complete list)?
 - Hits-module: changeable IP-Blocking?
 - Number of entrys/time period
   (how many different referer domains this month? year-view with all months)
 - Automatic (ajax?) refresh every x minutes (optional)
 - "live log view": log file (viewed as a table) refreshes automatically
 - "dynamic GUI":
   - Modules can be dragged & dropped & resized
   (-> Dynamic Drive DHTML Window Widget + Modal Window)
   - User can save his view and share it with others online
   - New Standard-views:
 	- technical settings (Browser, systems, color depth)
 	- Hits/Time (Day/Month/Year)
 	- Files (Files / Referer)
   - User can "minimize" modules
 - Month-Cache/Split-Cache/Universal-Cache
 - Settings-GUI, Installer (simpel/advanced)
 - Make all data available to other scripts, e.g  User online, Hits, etc.
 - User online Max
 - Clickcounter: New Module Clickcounter, which counts clicks on downloads/links/...
   Maybe tab in "files" module?. Possibility to show the number of clicks
   next to the download-link
 - "Without JavaScript"-Setting
 - Page Visit Time: Average time users spend on site, on particular sites,
   (files-module?), total time spent
 - Improve coding (structure / OOP!)
 - (Counter: include background image)
 - StatServer-Docu
 - Country or Language of visitors (Maxmind GeoIP Country/City?)
 - improve queryregex.txt (more engines, not all sites etc ...)
 - How many visitors come from which search engine? (search-engine-module?)
 - Diagrams using jpGraph? (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/)
 - Filter supports PCRE
 - Entrypages/Exitpages
 - Tendencys
 - Log Session-Variables (username, ...)
 - replace mktree with noAjax-Version of ajaxTree?
 - error-message when rel-path is wrong
 - categorize files (ajaxTree?)
 - Report unknown browser / systems
 - Limit Time-Modules to system attributes/files/referers/search phrases
  -> e.g. Month-module: Referer google -> development of Google-click-throughs
  -> e.g. Month-module: Browser Firefox -> How has the use of this browser changed?
  -> e.g. day-module: file xy.z -> How often was this file opened in the last days?
 - export data of a module as excel/openoffice/libreoffice/csv-file? (including diagrams?)
