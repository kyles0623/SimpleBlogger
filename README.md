# SimpleBlogger

This is a project I did in high school. I was really into Web Development 
and was using Joomla for everything. So then I grabbed
a copy of the book 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/PHP-CMS-Framework-Development-Edition/dp/1849511349">PHP 5 CMS Framework Development</a>.
I started working on my own Content Management System that is a basic Blogging Application. The System has an admin section,
a main section, a MySQL DB and a templating feature. The templates are simple, 1 page templates that can be customized.

The only issue is that I have lost the original DB implementation. I will try to reverse engineer it one day but for now
there is no SQL to create the DB.
